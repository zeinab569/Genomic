# theblast

A new Flutter project.
Implementation of BLAST(Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm in Dart.
This code can provide you with a glimpse of how BLAST works and how it can actually be realised in code.
This BLAST search is based on nucleotide-nucleotide search. Amino acid search  we may be provided on this repository.
Sorry for lack of comments in the source code. This change will also be done soon.
